Several projects I built for the Udemy -"Artificial Intelligence for Robotics" Nano degree most of them contain parts of or very closely follow the example coder they give you so I by no means claim that any of these ideas are mine. however I did build the code myself without looking at the examples so the actual formating ect is(Mostly!) mine.

There are several projects these include:
Lesson 1(Localization Overview):
- A full 1D localize script for localisation in a 1d space

Lesson 2(Problem set 1):
- A full 2d localize script for localization in a 2d space
